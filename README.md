# rust-browserchecks
browserfinger printing


This is the beginning of a repo to check the browserfinger print of the local machine


TODO
In order for this to be a proper BFP checker, there needs to be a JS execution frontend to send results to the backend. 
This is a much larger project than initially intended. Will get back to to it.
